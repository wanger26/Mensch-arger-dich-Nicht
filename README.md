# Mensch-arger-dich-Nicht
## Description 
This app provides a modern version of the classic board game Mensch Ã¤rger Dich nicht to your mobile phone. In the game you will play against three opponents that want to win just as bad as you! Good luck, and let the dice be with you!
## Motivation
I created this project to create an app that modernizes a classic board game while practing my development skills.
## Build Status
Finished with no plan to expand at this time. 
## Navigation
The app was created using Android Studio. Hence, the Java files can be found in *Mensch-arger-dich-Nicht/MenschargerDichnicht/app/src/main/java/com/example/menschargerdichnicht/*, and the XML files in *Mensch-arger-dich-Nicht/MenschargerDichnicht/app/src/main/res/layout/*.
## Style
When reading the code you will immediately notice the app was created with an object orientated approach that provides good encapsulation of objects. In addition, if you look closer at the code you will notice a factory design pattern was used in the creating of the AI's. 
## Installation
You can install the app through the google play store at the following URL https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jw.menschargerdichnicht
